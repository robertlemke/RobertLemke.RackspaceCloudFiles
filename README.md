Rackspace Cloud Files API for TYPO3 Flow
========================================

NOTE: THIS IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS

This package provides an API to the Rackspace CloudFiles REST service. Communication is handled through Flow's virtual browser by using the CurlEngine.

Additionally, this package introduces Rackspace CloudFiles as a new resource storage and publishing target. Through this mechanism it is possible to publish static and persistent resources to the cloud and the Content Delivery Network.

Finally, a set of commands is available at the command line to check connection, upload files etc.
